this project aims to implement three CPU scheduling algorithims: First-Come First-Served (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), and Priority Scheduling in C++

files:
Scheduler.cc - does it all, contains main and algorithms for fcfs sjf and priority scheduling

makefile instructions: 
run `make` to compile the program
run `./Scheduler.cc <input_file.csv` to use the prgram
run `make clean` to remove the compiled class files
